## Communication Expectations

Use the separate discord chat channels accordingly.

## Change Requests

## Team Agreement Maintenance
* Agreement meetings can take place as the team deems necessary.
* Somebody calls a need for change. During the review, the requestor will have a chance to persuade others in the group to agree and be open to rebuttals. We take a majority vote to see if it passes.
* We will review each bullet point and determine if current rules are still acceptable, need tweaking, or removed, or new rules need to be added.
