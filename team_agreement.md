## Communication Expectations

- Communicate with the group what work you have completed, began working on, and plan to start working on.
- If you must be unreliable, please at least communicate that with the group so we can pick up the slack. This is separate from unavailability, which should also be communicated to the group.
- Delegate roles or responsibilities in discord such that people can refer to it if needed.
  Use the separate discord chat channels accordingly.
- Communicate if you are unable to meet our reasonable expectations, such as if you are running late.

## Meeting Structure and Availability Expectations

- The start of Monday's class and the end of Wednesday's class will be the primary scheduled meeting. Any additional meetings will be impromptu messaging in Discord or a call if needed.
- Meetings will be, previous work, open comments, looking forward.

## Change Requests

- A majority vote is required to change the agreement, the professor can act as a tiebreaker ONLY when STRICTLY required.

## Team Agreement Maintenance

- Agreement meetings can take place as the team deems necessary.
- Somebody calls a need for change. During the review, the requestor will have a chance to persuade others in the group to agree and be open to rebuttals. We take a majority vote to see if it passes.
- We will review each bullet point and determine if current rules are still acceptable, need tweaking, or removed, or new rules need to be added.
