### What problems did you run into? What is your plan for them?

The old boards I built had issues with repeated outputs with different inputs. It was also just not put together very well and did not fit well in the housing.

### What is the current overall project status from your perspective?

We are about 85% complete at this point and have almost finished our working prototype, with all major components attached. We have been running into some issues now with adjusting tolerances and gettting click events to work well.

### How is your team functioning from your perspective?

The team is still functioning very well together and we have all worked well in getting all of our work done. There is nobody that has fallen behind or contributed too little.

### What new ideas did you have or skills did you develop this week?

I have continued soldering and building necessary circuitry.

### Who was your most awesome team member this week and why?

Kris was the most awesome teammate as he spent a ton of time tweaking the code and trying to get our protoype working good for the status demo and user studies.

## Plans for Next Week

Finish up the code for the buttons and help with mouse movement and finger based events.
