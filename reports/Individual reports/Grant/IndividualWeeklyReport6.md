_Include screenshots/diagrams/figures/etc. to illustrate what you did this past week._

None

### What problems did you run into? What is your plan for them?

I had a small issue with the encoders. I did not realize that the data sheet had very small in paratheses that the inverse logic was used, so all 0's were 1's and all 1's were 0's. The encoder is still usable but I had to slightly change how the circuity was wired.

### What is the current overall project status from your perspective?

The project is still moving along well and we are getting prepared to put the new components into the glove itself. This will likely be the more difficult than previous tasks as we will need to 3D parts to increase the space in the button and microcontroller housings on the glove.

### How is your team functioning from your perspective?

The team is still working well and we have been making steady progress still.

### What new ideas did you have or skills did you develop this week?

I had some ideas on what to do with some of the buttons like opening commonly used applications. This may involve mapping buttons to different keyboard inputs like ctrl+shift+1, which the user will need to set up in their OS to open the app of their choice.

### Who was your most awesome team member this week and why?

Kris was the most awesome teammate as he bought a new accelerometer and wrote some code to make the mouse movement work with translation rather than just being tilt based.

## Plans for Next Week

Wire encoder to the actual buttons and place all the pcb boards inside the button housing. Start creating buttons press events to perform tasks on users machine.
_What are you going to work on this week?_
Begin actual glove assembly to create a functional protoype for further testing and devoplment.
