## Current Status

### What did _you_ work on this past week?

| Task                                | Status      | Time Spent |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| Started adding the code for buttons | In progress | 5hr        |

_Include screenshots/diagrams/figures/etc. to illustrate what you did this past week._

### What problems did you run into? What is your plan for them?

When I first wrote the code to check which button was being pressed, the matchButton function caused a lot of lag with the mouse movement due to running a nested loop every iteration. To fix this I added a check at the beginning of the function to check if the inputs match no button being pressed which greatly increased speed.

### What is the current overall project status from your perspective?

The project is about 85-90% done at this point. We have mostly every intended feature implemented just need to continue to refine them to improve usability.

### How is your team functioning from your perspective?

The team is still functioning pretty well and mostly everyone is pulling their weight.

### What new ideas did you have or skills did you develop this week?

I worked on writing more Arduino code and focused on writing optimized algorithms to avoid largely slowing down the main loop in our code.

### Who was your most awesome team member this week and why?

Will was the most awesome teammate as he easily fixed our issue with clicking while moving the mouse.

## Plans for Next Week

Completely finish the glove and get our presentations fully prepared.
_What are you going to work on this week?_
Finish the buttons completely and help with other code.
