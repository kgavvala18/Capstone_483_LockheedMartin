### What problems did you run into? What is your plan for them?

The only problem I have encountered is dealing with soldering and connecting very small wires while avoiding shorts.

### What is the current overall project status from your perspective?

We are about 75% complete at this point and have created a working prototype, although very rough. The buttons will soon be ready to attach to the rest of the glove.

### How is your team functioning from your perspective?

The team is still functioning very well together and we have all worked well in getting all of our work done. There is nobody that has fallen behind or contributed too little.

### What new ideas did you have or skills did you develop this week?

I have practiced building circuits and learned about pull-up and pull-down resistor configurations.

### Who was your most awesome team member this week and why?

Kris was the most awesome teammate as he spent a lot of time getting the prototype working and polishing out the mouse movement with the new accelerometer, which much improved the smoothness of the mouse control.

## Plans for Next Week

Completely finish the buttons and get them wired to the microcontroller. Then I can begin writing code for the shortcuts the buttons will use.
_What are you going to work on this week?_
Adding the buttons to the prototype and getting the code setup to handle button presses.
