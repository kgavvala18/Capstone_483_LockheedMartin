### What problems did you run into? What is your plan for them?

I ran into an issue with the encoders we have as they require all inputs below the highest signigance input to be high to work properly. This does not work well with the way we want the buttons to work unless we add a large amount of circuitry.

### What is the current overall project status from your perspective?

I think we are over halfway done with the project in total, but the hardest parts will be coming up. Creating our own driver and implementing the more complicated functionality could prove to be more difficult than anything we have done so far.

### How is your team functioning from your perspective?

The team is still functioning very well together and we have all worked well in getting all of our work done. There is nobody that has fallen behind or contributed too little.

### What new ideas did you have or skills did you develop this week?

I have practiced in writing Arduino code and soldered even more things, which were very small.

### Who was your most awesome team member this week and why?

Brint was the most awesome teammate this week due to his work he did at home including researching and setting up basic driver development.

## Plans for Next Week

This week I will do more research on encoders so I can purchase some that work well for our intended goals. I will also begin writing code for the buttons on our actual microcontroller so that they have actual functionality.
_What are you going to work on this week?_
I will purchase the correct encoders and wire the buttons to them and begin to create functionality for each button.
