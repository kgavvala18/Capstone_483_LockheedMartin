## Current Status
The glove is coming together very quickly and we now have a working prototype. I would say that the glove is 80% done. We do need to pick it up a bit though and will be on crunch time this week.

### What problems did you run into? What is your plan for them?

Same problems as before. I ran into the issue of getting the hand to light up when a control is pressed. We need to get the drivers done and hooked up to it and get an SVG that we can light up portions of.

### What is the current overall project status from your perspective? 

I would say that the project is about 80% done. This has not really changed. Now that we are all done with exams, we are on crunch time.

### How is your team functioning from your perspective?

The team is functioning well and we have minimal issues. A lot of us have been getting sick and had a lot of exams in the last few weeks which has really set us back.

### What new ideas did you have or skills did you develop this week?

I had the idea to create a 3D model of the hand for the GUI menu. This could also be an SVG as before, currently investigating.

### Who was your most awesome team member this week and why?

Aaron was my most awesome team member of the week because he did a lot of work in soldering and helping to get the glove put together.

## Plans for Next Week

*What are you going to work on this week?*

I am going to work on getting the drivers working and the GUI connected to it for keybinds and stuff.
