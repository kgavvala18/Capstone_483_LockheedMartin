## Current Status
The glove is coming together very quickly and we now have a working prototype. I would say that the glove is 80% done.

### What problems did you run into? What is your plan for them?

I ran into the issue of getting the hand to light up when a control is pressed. We need to get the drivers done and hooked up to it and get an SVG that we can light up portions of.

### What is the current overall project status from your perspective? 

I would say that the project is about 80% done. It is coming along pretty fast and as more of us finish up midterms it is going to accelerate a lot.

### How is your team functioning from your perspective?

The team is functioning well and we have minimal issues. A lot of us have been getting sick in the last few weeks which has really set us back.

### What new ideas did you have or skills did you develop this week?

I did not have any new ideas except for maybe the SVG for the hand. I developed skills using electron js.

### Who was your most awesome team member this week and why?

Brint was my most awesome team member this week because he did 3D printed the glove spacer and is working on getting it working well.

## Plans for Next Week

*What are you going to work on this week?*

I am going to work on getting the drivers working and the GUI connected to it for keybinds and stuff.
