1. Give yourselves a pat on the back\! List the teamâ€™s accomplishments.

   The team managed to get the flex sensors in the glove and get them working with both left and right click. The team also implemented automated testing on GitHub and has been making good progress on getting the screen zoom and mouse scroll to work. The team also got progress on the glove buttons.

2. How is the team doing with communication? How will the team adjust going forward? 

   Overall communication has been good. We need to adjust by doing better with our task management in Jira.

3. How is the team doing with time? (Is the project on track, behind schedule, ahead of schedule?) How will the team adjust going forward?  
     
   We are on track to where we want to be. We have made good progress and will be able to work on stretch goals later down the road. The team will adjust by trying to get ahead in preparation for spring break.
