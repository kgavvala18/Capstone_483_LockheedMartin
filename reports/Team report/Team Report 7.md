# Team Weekly Report

**Team**: The Gauntlet

**Week**: 7

**Members**: David, Grant, Brint, Kris, Aaron, Will

## Status Report

The team's overall progress is good. The glove is coming together swiftly and although we have had some setbacks from members being sick, progress has been good.
There has been work on hooking up the buttons to the encoders, getting everything soldered for the status demo, and some more mouse movement along with some gestures.
We have made progress on the 3D printing side but are having difficulties with the strange geometry of the parts we are trying to print for. The GUI has made progress
but now it needs some drivers to connect the keybinds to the glove and be able to light up a hand SVG properly. The drivers have been difficult to do because none of our
members have experience working on Windows drivers.


## Current Status
The glove is coming along very well and we have a working prototype. We are working on getting the housing, the buttons, the drivers, and the GUI to work.

### What did the team work on this past week?

| Task | Task Lead | Status | Notes |
| ---- | --------- | ------ | ----- |
|   GUI   |      Will     |    In Progress    |   Needs the drivers to continue    |
|   Soldering   |      Aaron     |    Complete    |   Will need to be changed again    |
|   Buttons   |     Grant      |    In Progress    |   Hooked up to the encoders    |
|   Mouse Movement Code   |     Kris      |    In Progress    |    Need to experiment with deadzones   |
|   3D Printing   |     Brint      |    In Progress    |    Hard to measure irregular surfaces accurately   |
|   Gestures   |     David      |    In Progress    |   Needs drivers to finish    |

### What feedback has the team receieved?

| From Whom | Feedback | Next Steps |
| --------- | -------- | ---------- |
|     Ritchey      |     Need clear demo (would like the GUI lightup thing)     |      Get the drivers working + SVG      |
|     Trevor      |     Try to ensure form factor with 3D printing     |      Keep our solutions minimally invasive to form factor      |
|           |          |            |

### Are any resources needed? If so, what?
We need a new charger piece and may need a new bluetooth module.

## Plans for Next Week

| Task | Task Lead | Notes |
| ---- | --------- | ----- |
|   Finish the buttons   |      Grant     |    They are hooked up to the encoders and are being put in the glove soon   |
|   Finish the cursor   |     Kris      |    Experimenting with deadzones and some other techniques   |
|   Finish the gestures   |      David     |    Gestures are coming along decently but need more precision   |
|   Finish the drivers   |      Will/Brint     |    Windows drivers are a new experience and are taking some time   |
|   Finish the 3D printing   |     Brint      |    3D printing is facing some challenges with the geometry   |
|   Finish putting glove together   |     Aaron      |    Ordered more flex sensors since one of them is bending   |
