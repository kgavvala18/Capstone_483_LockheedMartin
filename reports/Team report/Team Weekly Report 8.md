*Write a one-third to one-half page status report describing the team’s overall progress and challenges faced last week. Also discuss the team’s goals and plan for this week.*

Last week, our group wrapped up all the individual components for the glove and it is partially assembled. We did have an issue with several members being ill which delayed our progress.   
The team will be finishing the glove’s assembly and will be moving on to getting the drivers. The next steps will be finishing the drivers, integrating them into the GUI, and getting all of the software and events onto the glove. We now have a prototype of the 3D printed spacer and will be getting a finalized version quickly.
