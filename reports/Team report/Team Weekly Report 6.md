The overall progress is that the glove is nearing a functional prototype. The assembly work is underway and will be completed soon along with having some gestures set up. The GUI is also being developed and will be finished in time. The translation code and the button encoder were both completed and are ready for the next steps. The development environment for the drivers has been set up and the parts are being designed for 3D printing. The challenges faced last week included the error from the magnetometer. The team had to purchase a better one to reduce the errors after integrating it.  
Our goal for this week is to assemble the glove to have a prototype that we can test. We want to integrate all of the separate pieces onto the glove such as the flex sensors, controller, and buttons. While this occurs, some team members will continue software development, making drivers, the GUI, and new events.
