The team has made good progress on the glove and we are now finishing up the last of the code. After getting the gesture detection code working fully, all we need is to convert the rest of the gesture code. The team faced several challenges this week such as the gesture detection code having conflicts among the fingers and requiring stabilization detection. Also one of the flex sensors broke but that will be an easy swap out.

Our goal for this coming week is to complete our user studies and spend the remaining time refining the code. We want to use the feedback from our users to create the best experience possible while eliminating any bugs.
