| Status Report |
| :---- |

*Write a one-third to one-half page status report describing the team’s overall progress and challenges faced last week. Also discuss the team’s goals and plan for this week.*

The team has made good progress last week. The buttons have been assembled and the sensors have all been soldered in. The glove has now been mostly assembled with the main goal now being to make it pretty.
The team faced some challenged with fitting all of the sensors and wires within the enclosure and have been working on getting 3D printed pieces to remedy this.
The goals for this coming week are to finish assembling the glove and getting everything secured, finish integrating the gestures and buttons into the codebase, get the zoom functionality working, and if time permits, work on the drivers.
