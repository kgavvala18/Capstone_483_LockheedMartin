The team has made great progress and we believe we are close to finalzing the code, we just need to attempt to refine it to work better. We have gotten gesture code implemented it is just now down to refining it to work better. We continued to have issues with gesutures overlapping but we believe we have found a way to avoid most issues with that. We also once again had some hardware troubles but luckily we were easily able to fix it.

Our goal for this coming week is to complete our user studies and spend the remaining time refining the code. We want to use the feedback from our users to create the best experience possible while eliminating any bugs.
